<p align="center">Fullstack React/Typescript/NestJs starter, heavily based off of <a href="https://github.com/gilamran/fullstack-typescript" target="blank">fullstack-typescript</a> by <a href="https://github.com/gilamran" target="blank">gilamran</a>.</p>

### Quick Start

Just fork the repo and then clone your forked repository into your own project folder.

```
git clone <YourRepoUrl> <YourProjectName>
cd <YourProjectName>
npm install
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up
npm start
```

If you want, you can just clone and detach from this repository into your own repository do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/heuristicAL/fullstack-ts-react-nest.git <YourProjectName>
cd <YourProjectName>
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
git push -u origin master
```

## Why

- **Simple** to jump into, **Fast** because it is simple.
- Separate `tsconfig.json` for client and server.
- Client and server can share code (And types).
- The client is bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) because it goes to the browser.
- The server is emitted by [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) because node 6 supports es6.

- [NestJs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)

### Usage
> Before running any of the following commands, you should cope `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory, substituting in your own variables.<br/>
> **Read the docker commands below to setup a local DB for the server.**

- `npm start` - Client and server are in watch mode with source maps, opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run test` - Runs jest tests
- `npm run build` - `dist` folder will include all the needed files, both client (Bundle) and server.
- `npm run prod` - Just runs `node ./dist/server/server.js`, run `npm run build` before this.

#### Docker commands

- `docker-compose up` - Spins up a local Postgres image, reading environment variables from the root `.env` file.
- `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.build.yml build` - Builds a production docker image for the app. **Run the npm build script first**
- `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.build.yml up` - Spins up the production docker container. Builds it first if it has not been built yet.

#### Client-Only

The server & client components of this starter are loosely coupled, and you may decide to develop a static frontend using only the client component.

For **client only** development using this starter:

- Modify `views/page.ejs` to use static `<src>` links rather than templated values.

### Config

All applications require a config mechanism, for example, `SLACK_API_TOKEN`. Things that you don't want in your git history, you want a different environment to have different value (dev/staging/production). This repo uses the file `config.ts` to access and setup all pre-nest init app variables. And a `.env` file to override variable in dev environment. This file is ignored from git.
Once Nest is up and running, there is a [ConfigService](https://github.com/heuristicAL/fullstack-ts-react-nest/blob/master/server/src/config/config.service.ts) which can be injected on-demand.
